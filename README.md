# Project Name:
 All-Hypothesis-Test-stastistical-Inference
# üìä Hypothesis Testing Project Overview
This repository contains a collection of hypothesis testing projects using real and simulated datasets. Each notebook walks through a different statistical test used to validate or reject assumptions about data. The tests cover a variety of use cases such as comparing means, proportions, and relationships between categorical variables.
# Files:
-`Hypothesis_Test_Final.ipynb` Python File in Project
# üéØ Objective
To demonstrate practical applications of hypothesis testing using Python (pandas, numpy, scipy, seaborn, matplotlib). The goal is to solve real-world problems with appropriate statistical tests and to interpret results correctly using p-values and confidence intervals.

## üìä Hypothesis Testing Project Overview

This repository contains a collection of hypothesis testing projects using real and simulated datasets. Each notebook walks through a different statistical test used to validate or reject assumptions about data. The tests cover a variety of use cases such as comparing means, proportions, and relationships between categorical variables.

### üéØ Objective

To demonstrate practical applications of **hypothesis testing** using Python (pandas, numpy, scipy, seaborn, matplotlib). The goal is to solve real-world problems with appropriate statistical tests and to interpret results correctly using p-values and confidence intervals.

## ‚úÖ Outcome

Each project includes:

* A clear hypothesis statement (H‚ÇÄ and H‚ÇÅ)
* Data loading and cleaning
* Visual exploration
* Test assumptions (normality, variance)
* Performing the statistical test
* Interpretation of the result
* Business or scientific conclusion
