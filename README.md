# Project Name:
 All-Hypothesis-Test-stastistical-Inference
# ðŸ“Š Hypothesis Testing Project Overview
This repository contains a collection of hypothesis testing projects using real and simulated datasets. Each notebook walks through a different statistical test used to validate or reject assumptions about data. The tests cover a variety of use cases such as comparing means, proportions, and relationships between categorical variables.

# ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To demonstrate practical applications of hypothesis testing using Python (pandas, numpy, scipy, seaborn, matplotlib). The goal is to solve real-world problems with appropriate statistical tests and to interpret results correctly using p-values and confidence intervals.
